The interferograms are stored at the <a href=\"https://asf.alaska.edu/\">NASA Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) DAAC</a>, and are accessible with an Open Source set of tools called ARIA-tools. The Miami Insar Timeseries software in PYthon (MintPy), an open-source package for InSAR time-series analysis, is compatible with the outputs from the ARIA-tools package, and in combination with the ARIA-tools pre-processor can be used to estimate ground displacement time-series. \n\nThe Jupyter notebook presented here is meant as an practical example on the use of Jupyter for exploring landslide displacements. In the example below, we will demonstrate a time-series derived from ARIA standard InSAR products over the Los Angeles, California area revealing landslide motion on the Palos Verdes peninsula. \n\nSee the other tutorials on ARIA-tools to learn more about how to use that package.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n<b>To save time, we have pre-run the ARIA-tools package and data loading into MintPy</b> \n\n!ariaDownload.py -b '33.5 34.5 -119.0 -117.9' --track 71\n    \n!ariaTSsetup.py -f 'products/*.nc' -b '33.65 33.9 -118.45 -118.15' --mask Download\n    \n!smallbaselineApp.py -t LASenDT71.txt --dostep load_data\n    \n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n \n<b>The staged data was uploaded in S3 data bucket of openSARlab and can be downloaded using:</b>\n    \n!aws s3 cp s3://asf-jupyter-data/Fielding/Stack.zip Stack.zip\n\nWhen users are not leveraging openSARlabs, they should start from ARIA-tools as download from S3 will not work.\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<hr>\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"5\" color='rgba(200,0,0,0.2)'> <b>Important Notes about Binder</b> </font>\n<br><br>\n<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\"> <b>The Binder server will automatically shutdown when left idle for more than 10 minutes.
