    "The Caltech-JPL ARIA project in partnership with NASA Getting Ready for NISAR (GRFN) project has been generated surface displacement products (interferograms) mimicking the NISAR L2 GUNW (Geocoded Unwrapped phase interferograms) product formatting. The interferograms are stored at the NASA ASF DAAC, and are accessible with an Open Source set of tools called ARIA-tools. The Miami Insar Timeseries software in PYthon (MintPy), an open-source package for InSAR time-series analysis, is compatible with the outputs from the ARIA-tools package, and in combination with the ARIA-tools pre-processor can be used to estimate ground displacement time-series. \n",

    "The Jupyter notebook presented here is meant as an practical example on the use of Jupyter for exploring landslide displacements. In the example below, we will demonstrate a time-series derived from ARIA standard InSAR products over the Los Angeles, California area revealing landslide motion on the Palos Verdes peninsula. \n",

    "In addition to timeseries.h5 which contains the time-series dataset, invert_network produces other quantities, which contain metrics to evaluate the quality of the inversion including temporalCoherence.h5. Temporal coherence represents the consistency of the timeseries with the network of interferograms. \n",

    "Temporal coherence varies from 0 to 1. Pixels with values closer to 1 are considered reliable and pixels with values closer to zero are considered unreliable. For a dense network of interferograms, a threshold of 0.7 may be used (Yunjun et al, 2019)."
