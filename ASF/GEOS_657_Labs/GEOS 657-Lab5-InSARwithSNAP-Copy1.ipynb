    "<font size=\"3\"> The Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode is the main acquisition mode over land for <a href=\"https://www.asf.alaska.edu/sentinel/\" target=\"_blank\">Sentinel-1</a>. It acquires data with a 250 km swath at 5 m by 20 m spatial resolution (single look). IW captures three sub-swaths using the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans SAR (TOPSAR) acquisition principle. With the TOPSAR technique, in addition to steering the beam in range as in ScanSAR, the beam is also electronically steered from backward to forward in the azimuth direction for each burst, avoiding scalloping and resulting in homogeneous image quality throughout the swath. A schematic of the TOPSAR acquisition principle is shown to your right. For more information on TOPSAR please read <cite><a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1677745\"><i>TOPSAR: Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans</i></a> by De Zan & Monti Guarnieri</cite>. \n",

The individually focused complex burst images are included, in azimuth-time order, into a single sub-swath image with black-fill demarcation in between.\n",

Hence, the phase difference between these image acquisitions capture the cumulative co-seismic deformation caused by both of these seismic events. The footprint of the Sentinel-1 images is shown to your right and covers the areas affected by the earthquake. Hence, Sentinel-1 data are a good basis for studying earthquake-related surface deformation.\n",

    "<font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\"> For interferometric processing, two or more images must be co-registered into a common geometry. The geometry of one image is selected as the <i>master</i> geometry while the other images are often referred to as <i>slave</i> images.

    "Coregistration ensures that each ground target contributes to the same (range, azimuth) pixel in both the master and the slave image.

The hypocenter was located at a depth of 24.6 km and approximately 37 km northeast of Pinotepa de Don Luis.
