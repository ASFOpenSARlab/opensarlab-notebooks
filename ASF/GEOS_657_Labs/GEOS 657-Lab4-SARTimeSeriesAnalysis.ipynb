It introduces you to the analysis of deep multi-temporal SAR image data stacks in the framework of *Jupyter Notebooks*. The Jupyter Notebook environment is easy to launch in any web browser for interactive data exploration with provided or new training data. Notebooks are comprised of text written in a combination of executable python code and markdown formatting including latex style mathematical equations. Another advantage of Jupyter Notebooks is that they can easily be expanded, changed, and shared with new data sets or newly available time series steps. Therefore, they provide an excellent basis for collaborative and repeatable data analysis. <br>\n",

    "- How to load time series stacks into Jupyter Notebooks and how to explore image content using basic functions such as mean value calculation and histogram analysis.\n",
    "- How to apply calibration constants to covert initial digital number (DN) data into calibrated radar cross section information.\n",
    "- How to subset images create time series information of calibrated SAR amplitude values.\n",
