    "This Jupyter Notebook implements the SAR Wetland Extent Exploration Tool (SWEET), a thresholding-based approach to perform semi-automated mapping of wetland inundation.  Required inputs are intensity images of VV+VH polarization bands from Sentinel-1 C-SAR imagery.  Loaded images should already be co-registered, subset, radiometrically corrected, and in a projected coordinate system.  The notebook outputs classifications of typical, minimum, and maximum inundation states along with multi-looked classifications for individual dates.  The inundation classes are: open water, inundated, and not inundated. <br><br>\n",
    "Additional information on the software requirements, Python dependencies, usage instructions, and project directory structure can be found in the README file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** <br>\n",
    "Process Sentinel-1 VH/VV SAR data and produce maps showing wetland inundation extent in Alaska. Alaska is used as an example for this exercise. Application to other areas is possible. Note, however, that due to the limited penetration of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data, application in densely vegetated areas may lead to an underestimation of inundation extent.<br>\n",

    "- Read in data (assumes data is already subset and coregistered)\n",
    "- Select dates to include in analysis based on VV, VH, and VV/VH plots for each date and average backscatter timeseries plots (can exclude images that appear to have calibration errors)\n",
    "- Calculate multi-temporal averages for VV, VH, and VV/VH (Ia)\n",

    "<b>Background:</b><br>\n",
    "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric backscatter is a powerful datasource, with its ability to penetrate cloud cover and acquire imagery in low-light conditions.  Sentinel-1's C-band wavelength is particularly useful for wetland mapping, as the longer C-band wavelength can penetrate vegetation canopies to detect areas of inundated vegetation.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Sentinel-1 has dual polarization, where it can transmit a signal in either horizontal (H) or vertical (V) polarizations and receive signals back both vertically and horizontally.  This notebook uses both vertically transmitted vertically recieved (VV) and vertically transmitted horizontally received (VH) intensity images and backscatter values.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "With SAR, pulses of microwave energy are emitted and received by the radar instrument's atenna.  When the pulses hit smooth surfaces such as open water, the microwave energy scatters and reflects away, resulting in a low return of backscatter to the radar.  Thus, flat surfaces like water appear as dark targets in the image.  In cases of inundated vegetation, the microwaves scatter off both the flat open water and the vertically emerging vegetation, resulting in a \"double-bounce\" reflection.  In these double-bounce reflections, a large portion of the transmitted waves are reflected back to the radar, resulting in brighter areas in the image.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "VV signals are of interest as they capture the increased brightness from the \"double bounce\" effect that commonly occurs with areas of inundated vegetation. This effect is even stronger in HH and at L-band wavelengths. Hence, future systems such as NISAR will improve the inundation mapping performance further by providing HH polarization data at L-band.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To create an algorithm to identiy areas of inundation, we determined brightness threshold characteristics of inundated areas.  To identify shifts in inundation, we also looked at the changes over time in image brightness.\n",

    "\n",
    "<font face=\"Century Gothic\" size=\"3\">Multi-temporal SAR data data from Sentinel-1 are a good basis for identifying inundated areas and distinguish seasonal inundation from short term inundation. Note, however, that due to limited penetration into dense vegetation, the performance of C-band Sentinel-1 data for inundation mapping in Colombia will be limited. A better choice will be L-band SAR data from future missions such as NISAR. The higher penetration of L-band will improve inundation mapping performance. The same workflow can be used for these future L-band data. \n",
