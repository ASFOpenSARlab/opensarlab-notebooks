    "This notebook introduces you to a simple method to deliniate areas of active agriculture from SAR time series data. The method is based on the **Coefficient of Variation** and results in the detection of actively managed crop areas. The coefficient of vatiation approach will be used as the main algorithm for agriculture mapping by the upcoming NASA/ISRO SAR mssion NISAR. Hence, the approach demonstrated here can be applied to data from this future mission.\n",

    "The exercises will use *Jupyter Notebooks*, an environment that is easy to launch in any web browser for interactive data exploration with provided or new training data. Notebooks are comprised of text written in a combination of executable python code and markdown formatting including latex style mathematical equations. Another advantage of Jupyter Notebooks is that they can easily be expanded, changed, and shared with new data sets or newly available time series steps. Therefore, they provide an excellent basis for collaborative and repeatable data analysis.\n",

    "1. **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** is a Python library that provides high-level data structures and a vast variety of tools for analysis. The great feature of this package is the ability to translate rather complex operations with data into one or two commands. Pandas contains many built-in methods for filtering and combining data, as well as the time-series functionality. \n",
    "1. **[GDAL](https://www.gdal.org/)** is a software library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats. It includes a collection of programs tailored for geospatial data processing. Most modern GIS systems (such as ArcGIS or QGIS) use GDAL in the background.\n",
    "1. **[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)** is one of the principal packages for scientific applications of Python. It is intended for processing large multidimensional arrays and matrices, and an extensive collection of high-level mathematical functions and implemented methods makes it possible to perform various operations with these objects.\n",
    "1. **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html)** is a low-level library for creating two-dimensional diagrams and graphs. With its help, you can build diverse charts, from histograms and scatterplots to non-Cartesian coordinates graphs. Moreover, many popular plotting libraries are designed to work in conjunction with matplotlib.\n",
    "1. The **[asf-hyp3 API](https://www.pydoc.io/pypi/asf-hyp3-1.1.1/index.html)** provides useful functions and scripts for accessing and processing SAR data via the Alaska Satellite Facility's Hybrid Pluggable Processing Pipeline, or HyP3 (pronounced \"hype\").\n",
