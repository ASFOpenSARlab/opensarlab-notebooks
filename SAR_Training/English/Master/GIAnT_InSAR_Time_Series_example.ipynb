The previous eruption occurred in October 2005, prior to the launch of the Sentinel-1 satellites, which will be the source of data we use for this lab. We will be looking at the deformation that occurred prior to the volcano's 2018 eruption."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**About GIAnT**\n",
    "\n",
    "GIAnT is a Python framework that allows rapid time series analysis of low amplitude deformation signals. It allows users to use multiple time series analysis technqiues: Small Baseline Subset (SBAS), New Small Baseline Subset (N-SBAS), and Multiscale InSAR Time-Series (MInTS). As a part of this, it includes the ability to correct for atmospheric delays by assuming a spatially uniform stratified atmosphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "GIAnT has a number of limitations that are important to keep in mind as these can affect its effectiveness for certain applications. It implements the simplest time-series inversion methods. Its single coherence threshold is very conservative in terms of pixel selection. It does not include any consistency checks for unwrapping errors. It has a limited dictionary of temporal model functions. It cannot correct for atmospheric effects due to differing surface elevations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to use GIAnT**\n",
    "Although GIAnT is an incredibly powerful tool, it requires very specific input. Because of the input requirements, the majority of one's effort goes to getting the data into a form that GIAnT can manipulate and to creating files that tell GIAnT what to do. The general steps to use GIAnT are below. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Download Data\n",
    "- Identify Area of Interest\n",
    "- Subset (Crop) Data to Area of Interest\n",
    "- Prepare Data for GIAnT\n",
    "    - Adjust file names\n",
    "    - Remove potentially disruptive default values (optional)\n",
    "    - Convert data from '.tiff' to '.flt' format\n",
    "- Create Input Files for GIAnT\n",
    "    - Create 'ifg.list'\n",
    "    - Create 'date.mli.par'\n",
    "    - Make prepxml_SBAS.py\n",
    "    - Run prepxml_SBAS.py\n",
    "    - Make userfn.py\n",
    "- Run GIAnT\n",
    "    - PrepIgramStack.py*\n",
    "    - ProcessStack.py\n",
    "    - SBASInvert.py\n",
    "    - SBASxval.py\n",
    "- Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps from PrepIgramStack.py and above have been completed for you in order to save disk space and computation time. This allows us to concentrate on the usage of GIAnT and data visualization. Some of the code to create the prepatory files (e.g., 'ifg.list', 'date.mli.par', etc.) have been incldued for your potential use. More information about GIAnT can be found [here](http://earthdef.caltech.edu/projects/giant/wiki)."
