To learn more about Okmok volcano and its eruptive history, please visit the very informative site of the [Alaska Volcano Observatory](https://avo.alaska.edu/volcanoes/activity.php?volcname=Okmok&eruptionid=604&page=basic).\n",

The figure to the right shows the Okmok surface deformation as measured by GPS data from field campaigns conducted in 2000 and 2002.
