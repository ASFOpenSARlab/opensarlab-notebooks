    "This notebook will introduce you to the analysis of deep multi-temporal SAR image data stacks in the framework of *Jupyter Notebooks*. The Jupyter Notebook environment is easy to launch in any web browser for interactive data exploration with provided or new training data. Notebooks are comprised of text written in a combination of executable python code and markdown formatting including latex style mathematical equations. Another advantage of Jupyter Notebooks is that they can easily be expanded, changed, and shared with new data sets or newly available time series steps. Therefore, they provide an excellent basis for collaborative and repeatable data analysis. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library that provides high-level data structures and a vast variety of tools for analysis. The great feature of this package is the ability to translate rather complex operations with data into one or two commands. Pandas contains many built-in methods for filtering and combining data, as well as the time-series functionality.\n",
    "- [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org/) is a software library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats. It includes a collection of programs tailored for geospatial data processing. Most modern GIS systems (such as ArcGIS or QGIS) use GDAL in the background.\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is one of the principal packages for scientific applications of Python. It is intended for processing large multidimensional arrays and matrices, and an extensive collection of high-level mathematical functions and implemented methods makes it possible to perform various operations with these objects.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html) is a low-level library for creating two-dimensional diagrams and graphs. With its help, you can build diverse charts, from histograms and scatterplots to non-Cartesian coordinates graphs. Moreover, many popular plotting libraries are designed to work in conjunction with matplotlib.\n",
    "- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/about.html) is a library that provides functions for numerical integration, interpolation, optimization, linear algebra and statistics.\n",
